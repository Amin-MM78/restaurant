This project is about a hypothetical restaurant called Tasty.
In the back end  this project uses the Django MVC 
And front end is done by HTML CSS and javascript,
I used MYSQL for data base.
Tasy is a full option restaurant you can see menu, reserve a table 
Our chef will be satisfied to send him and email and explain your opinion about his food.
And alsor Read the beautiful words of the chef:)))
